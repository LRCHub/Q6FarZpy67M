[00:11.25] Something bad is 'bout to happen to me
[00:17.26] I don't know it, but I feel it coming
[00:22.02] Might be so sad, might leave my nose running
[00:27.65] I just hope she don't wanna leave me
[00:45.65] 
[00:33.23] Don't you give me up, please don't give up
[00:42.12] Honey, I belong with you, and only you, baby
[00:45.54] Only you, my girl, only you, babe (you)
[00:47.50] Only you, darling, only you, babe (you)

[00:52.62] Something bad is 'bout to happen to me
[01:00.13] Why I feel this way, I don't know, baby

[01:05.88] I just don't want her to leave me

[01:40.79] What if she's fine?
[01:42.28] It's my mind that's wrong
