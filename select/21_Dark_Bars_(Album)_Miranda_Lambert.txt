I'm here for the habit
Complimentary matches
The pretty bartenders
The smoke and the mirrors
The unhappy hours
The bitters and sours
Where nobody knows me
Where I can be lonely

I'm not in pain, I'm not on pills
But I'm still hanging out in dark bars
On a bar stool for the cheap thrills
Watchin' drunks all drown with no lifeguard
'Cause I know a thing or two about broke hearts
Neon truth can hit real hard
In a dark bar

I can be wreckless
I can be desperate
An invisible stranger
Secrets never in danger
And it ain't nothin' fancy
'Cause the manager, Nancy
She's an old jukebox junkie
She plays nothin' but country

I'm not in pain, I'm not on pills
But I'm still hanging out in dark bars
On a bar stool for the cheap thrills
Watchin' drunks all drown with no lifeguard
'Cause I know a thing or two about broke hearts
Neon truth can hit real hard, ooh

No, I'm not in pain, I'm not on pills
But I'm still hanging out in dark bars
On a bar stool for the cheap thrills
Watchin' drunks all drown with no lifeguard
'Cause I know a thing or two about broke hearts
Neon truth can hit real hard
In a dark bar
